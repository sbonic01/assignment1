    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>I am working on a master's degree in Computer Science. I am not entirely sure what I will want to do with the degree. I wanted to take this class to explore the field of web development a bit and gain skills in case I decide I want to go into that field. Plus, I think it will be fun to learn how to make websites!</p>
    <p>While I do not have previous web programming experience, I have taken nine Computer Science courses at Tufts. This includes a Software Engineering course, as well as several other courses that involved coding basics and projects, such as the introductory course, data structures, and an operating systems course.</p>
